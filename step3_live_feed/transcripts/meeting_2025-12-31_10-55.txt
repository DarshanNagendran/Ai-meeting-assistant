[10:53:09] Hello everyone.
[10:53:11] Thank you guys for coming, Jarry.
[10:53:13] student success meeting.
[10:53:15] and let's just...
[10:53:17] get started. So I have our
[10:53:19] list of chronically absent students.
[10:53:21] here and I've been
[10:53:23] noticing a troubling trend.
[10:53:25] A lot of students.
[10:53:27] are skipping on Fridays.
[10:53:29] Does anyone have any idea what's going on?
[10:53:31] going on? I've heard...
[10:53:33] Some of my mentees talking about how.
[10:53:35] It's really hard to get out of bed on-
[10:53:37] on Fridays. It might be
[10:53:39] I think that if we did something like a pan...
[10:53:40] and cake breakfast to encourage them to...
[10:53:42] to come. I think that's...
[10:53:44] That's a great idea. Let's try.
[10:53:46] that next week.
[10:53:48] It might also be because...
[10:53:49] a lot of students have been getting sick.
[10:53:51] now that it's getting colder outside.
[10:53:53] I've had a number of students come to me.
[10:53:55] by my office with symptoms.
[10:53:57] sniffling and coughing.
[10:53:59] to put up posters with tips for not-
[10:54:07] getting six and some is fluelce diplomatic training for the
[10:54:08] and wash your hands after this.
[10:54:10] bathroom stuff like that.
[10:54:12] I think that's a good idea.
[10:54:14] And it'll be a good reminder for the team.
[10:54:16] features as well.
[10:54:18] So one of the things I wanted to talk.
[10:54:20] about. There's this.
[10:54:22] student I've noticed here, John.
[10:54:23] He's a mess.
[10:54:25] seven days already and it's
[10:54:27] only November. Does anyone?
[10:54:29] and have an idea what's going on with him.
[10:54:31] I might be able to finish.
[10:54:33] and the gaps there. I talked to John.
[10:54:34] today and he's really
[10:54:36] stressed out. He's been dealing.
[10:54:38] with helping his parents take care of him.
[10:54:45] The man in her dreams is Ellie.
[10:54:47] today. And it
[10:54:49] It may actually be a good idea if he's-
[10:54:51] to the guidance counselor a little bit.
[10:54:53] I can talk to John.
[10:54:54] today if you want to send them to my
[10:54:56] office after you meet with him.
[10:54:58] It's a lot to deal with first.
[10:55:00] middle schooler.
[10:55:01] Great thanks and and
[10:55:03] I can help out with the families.
[10:55:05] child care needs. I'll look for
[10:55:07] some free or low cost.
[10:55:08] resources in the community.
[10:55:10] to share with John and he can...
[10:55:12] share them with his family.
[10:55:14] Great, well some really good ideas here.
[10:55:15] Thank you for today. Thanks for...
[10:55:17] coming and if no one has any.
[10:55:19] anything else I think we can wrap up.
[10:55:20] Hello
