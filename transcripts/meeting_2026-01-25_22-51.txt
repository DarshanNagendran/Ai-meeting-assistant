[09:33:28] student success meeting.
[09:33:29] And let's just get...
[09:33:31] started. So I have our list.
[09:33:32] of chronically absent students.
[09:33:34] And I've been noticing.
[09:33:35] a troubling trend.
[09:33:37] A lot of students are...
[09:33:38] skipping on Fridays. Does it?
[09:33:40] Anyone have any idea what's going on?
[09:33:41] I've heard some of them.
[09:33:42] I meant he's talking about how it's...
[09:33:44] It's really hard to get out of bed on front.
[09:33:45] It might be good.
[09:33:47] we did something like a pancake.
[09:33:49] breakfast to encourage them to come.
[09:33:51] I think that's it.
[09:33:53] It's a great idea. Let's try that.
[09:33:56] It might also be because a lot of...
[09:33:59] Students have been getting sick now.
[09:34:01] that it's getting colder outside.
[09:34:03] I've had a number of students come by.
[09:34:05] my office was symptoms like sn...
[09:34:07] in coffee. We should put a-
[09:34:10] posters of tits for not getting.
[09:34:12] six inches on this flu season.
[09:34:15] like, you know, wash your hands after the bath.
[09:34:17] stuff like that.
[09:34:19] I think that's a good idea and it'll...
[09:34:21] be a good reminder for the teacher.
[09:34:24] as well.
[09:34:26] So one of the things I wanted to talk about.
[09:34:28] There's a student.
[09:34:30] I've noticed here John Smith.
[09:34:33] He's missed.
[09:34:35] seven days already and it's only
[09:34:37] November. Does anyone have?
[09:34:40] an idea what's going on with him.
[09:34:42] I might be able to fill in the...
[09:34:44] gaps there. I talked to John.
[09:34:46] and he's really stressed.
[09:34:48] out. He's been dealing with...
[09:34:50] of helping his parents take care of.
[09:34:53] of his younger siblings during the day.
[09:34:55] It may not.
[09:34:58] be a good idea if he spoke to the
[09:35:00] the guidance counselor a little bit.
[09:35:02] I can talk to John today.
[09:35:04] if you want a sentiment of my off.
[09:35:06] So after you meet with them.
[09:35:08] It's a lot to deal with for a minute.
[09:35:10] Great thanks and and.
[09:35:12] I can help out with the family's child.
[09:35:14] care needs. I'll look for some
[09:35:15] free or low cost.
[09:35:17] resources in the community.
[09:35:19] to share with John and he can share it.
[09:35:21] them with his family. Great.
[09:35:23] Well, some really good ideas here today.
[09:35:25] Thanks for coming.
[09:35:27] and if no one has anything...
[09:35:29] else, I think we can wrap up.
